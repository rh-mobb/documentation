Adopted from [Official Documentation for Cost Management Service](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/cost_management_service/2022)

Red Hat Cost Management is a software as a service (SaaS) offering available free of charge as part of your Red Hat subscriptions. Cost management helps you monitor and analyze your OpenShift Container Platform and Public cloud costs in order to improve the management of your business.

Some capabilities of cost management are :

* Visualize costs across hybrid cloud infrastructure
* Track cost trends
* Map charges to projects and organizations
* Normalize data and add markups with cost models
* Generate showback and chargeback information

In this document, I will show you how to connect your OpenShift and Cloud provider sources to Cost Management in order to collect cost and usage.

## Prerequisites

* A Public Cloud subscritption (Azure Subscription)
* An OpenShift Cluster *(to create an Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster, click [here](https://mobb.ninja/docs/quickstart-aro.html))*


## Adding your OpenShift source to Cost Management

### **Installing the Cost Management Metric Operator**

1. Log into the Openshift cluster web console with cluster-admin credentials

1. On the left navigation pane under Administator perspective, select **Operators** --> **OperatorHub**

   ![Operators view](./images/operators_view.png)

1. Search for and locate **cost management metrics operator**. Click on the displayed Cost Management Metrics Operator

   ![Operatorhub](./images/operatorhub.png)

1. When the Install Operator window appears, you must select the **costmanagement-metrics-operator namespace** for installation. If it does not exist, it will be created for you. Click on **install** button.

1. After a short wait, **Cost Management Metrics Operator** appears in the **Installed Operators** tab under **Project: all Projects** or **Project: costmanagement-metrics-operator**

### Configuring the Operator instance for a new installation

1. Once installed, click on the Cost Management

1. In the detail window, click **+ Create Instance**

1. A **Cost Management Metrics Operator > Create CostManagementMetricsConfig** window appears

1. Click the **YAML view** radio button to view and modify the contents of the YAML configuration file

   ![Cost management Metrics Config](./images/cm_yamlview.png)

1. Modify the following two lines in the YAML file to look like the following

   > Change `SOURCE-NAME` to the new name of your source (ex. `my-openshift-cost-source`)

   ```yaml
   create_source: true
   name: <SOURCE-NAME>
   ```

1. Click the **Create** button. This creates a new source for cost management that will appear in the **console.redhat.com** Cost Management applications

## Adding your Microsoft Azure source to Cost Management

### **1. Creating a Microsoft Azure Source in your Red Hat account**

1. In the [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/) click on **All apps and services** tab in the left top corner of the screen to navigate to this window. Click on **Sources** under **Settings**

   ![Access Sources link](./images/addingazuresource1.png)

1. On Sources page, click on **Cloud sources** tab and then click **Add a source**. This opens up the Sources Wizard

1. Enter a name for your source and click next

1. Select **cost management** as the application and **Microsoft Azure** as the source type.

1. Click **Next**. We will create the storage account and resource group in Azure account before proceeding. Keep this window open.

### **2. Configuring your Microsoft Azure**
The following steps are required to configure your Azure account to be a cost management source

1. Creating a storage account and resource group
1. Configuring a storage account contributor and reader roles for access
1. Scheduling daily exports

### 2.1 Creating an Azure resource group and storage account using Azure CLI

1. First create a new resource group

   ```bash
   az group create \
    --name storage-resource-group \
    --location eastus
   ```

1. If you're not sure which region to specify for the `--location` parameter, you can retrieve a list of supported regions for your subscription with the `az account list-locations` command.

   ```bash
   az account list-locations \
    --query "[].{Region:name}" \
    --out table
    ```

1. Next, create a standard general-purpose v2 storage account with read-access geo-redundant storage. Ensure the name of your storage account is unique across Azure

   ```bash
   az storage account create \
    --name <account-name> \
    --resource-group storage-resource-group \
    --location eastus \
    --sku Standard_RAGRS \
    --kind StorageV2
    ```

1. Make note of the resource group and storage account. We will need them in the subsequent steps

1. Return to **Sources** wizard in [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/), enter the **Resource group name** and **Storage account name** and click **Next**. Leave this window for now and proceed to next step below.

### 2.2 Configuring Azure roles using Azure CLI

We need to grant cost management read-only access to Azure cost data by configuring a Storage Account Contributor and Reader role in Azure

1. Run the following command to obtain your **Subscription ID**:

   ```bash
   SUBSCRIPTION=$(az account show --query "{subscription_id: id}" -o tsv)
   ```

1. Return to the [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/) **Sources** wizard, enter your **Subscription ID**. Click **Next** to move to the next screen

1. In Azure CLI, create a cost management Storage Account Contributor role, an obtain your **tenant ID**, **client (application) ID**, and **client secret**

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "CostManagement" \
      --role "Storage Account Contributor" \
      --query '{"tenant": tenant, "client_id": appId, "secret": password}'
    ```

1. Return to **Sources** wizard in [console.redhat.com](https://console.redhat.com/), enter your Azure **Tenant ID**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**.

1. Run the following command to create cost management Reader role with your subscription ID. Copy the full command from the **Sources** wizard, which will automatically substitute your Azure subscription ID obtained earlier.

   ```bash
   az role assignment create --role "Cost Management Reader" \
     --assignee http://CostManagement --subscription ${SUBSCRIPTION}
   ```
1. Click **Next** in **Sources** wizard.

### 2.3 Configuring a Daily Azure data export schedule using Azure Portal

*Cost management requires a data export from a **Subscription** level scope*

1. In the Azure Portal home page, click on **Subscriptions**

   ![Azure Portal home page](./images/subscriptionpg.png)

1. Select the Subscription you want to track from the list, and then select **Cost Analysis** in the menu. At the top of the **Cost analysis** page, select **configure subscription**

   ![Cost Analysis view](./images/cost-analysis.png)

1. Click on the **Export** tab, and then **Schedule export**

   ![Schedule export](./images/schedule-export.png)

1. In the **Exports** wizard, fill out the **Export details**

   ![Export details](./images/new-exports.png)

   * For **Export Type**, select **Daily export of billing-period-to-date costs** <br>

   * For **Storage account**, select the account you created earlier <br>

   * Enter any value for the **Container name** and **Directory path** for the export. These values provide the tree structure in the storage account where report files are stored.<br>

   * Click **Create** to start exporting data to the Azure storage container.

1. Return to **Sources** wizard after creating the export schedule and click **Next**. Review the source details

1. Click **Finish** to complete adding the Azure source to cost management

Cost management will begin polling Azure for cost data, which will appear on the cost management dashboard (console.redhat.com/openshift/cost-management/).

## Managing your Costs

After adding your Openshift Container Platform and Cloud Provider sources, Cost management will show cost data by

1. Source

1. Cloud provider cost and usage related to running your OpenShift Container Platform clusters on their platform
