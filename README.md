### Working from GitHub Code Spaces

You should be able to review PRs, preview branches, and even write new posts directly in code spaces.

1. In github look for the green **<> Code** button, choose that, click code spaces and the **+** button.

    This will bring up the code spaces interface.

1. In the **TERMINAL** run `make devspaces` which will create a preview hugo site for your branch

1. Click **Ports** and click the **Open in browser** icon.

You should now have a github space ready for writing content or reviewing PRs.
