Before deploying an ARO cluster, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:

## Setup Tools

- **Install Azure CLI**: Essential for managing Azure resources. Refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Verify Resources

- **Core Quota**: [Confirm availability of at least 40 cores](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests) to create and run an OpenShift Cluster.

## Permissions

- **RBAC Settings**:
  - Ensure you have **Contributor** and **User Access Administrator** roles on the cluster resource group.
  - Assign **Network Contributor** role on the virtual network, if using a separate resource group.
  - For stricter security policies, [create a custom role](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) with necessary permissions. [Reference link](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_azure/installing-azure-account.html#minimum-required-permissions-ipi-azure_installing-azure-account).
- **Microsoft Entra (Former Azure AD)**:
  - Have a member user of the tenant or a guest with **Application administrator** role for the tooling to create an application and service principal on your behalf for the cluster.
- **Terraform**: If you plan to use Terraform for the deployment of the cluster, [see here](https://github.com/rh-mobb/terraform-aro-permissions) the required permissions.

## Azure Integration

- **Resource Provider**:
  - Register the `Microsoft.RedHatOpenshift` resource provider. [Reference link](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider).
- **Red Hat Integration**:
  - Obtain a [Red Hat pull secret](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/azure/aro-provisioned) (Recommended for access to additional content like Operators and Container Registries).

## Domain Configuration 

This step is optional since you can use the built-in domain. 

- **Custom Domain**:
  - Post-cluster creation, configure two DNS A records for the specified domain:
    - `api` pointing to the API server IP.
    - `*.apps` pointing to the ingress IP.
  - Retrieve IP addresses using: `az aro show -n -g --query '{"api":apiserverProfile.ip, "ingress":ingressProfiles[0].ip}'`.
  - Access OpenShift console via `https://console-openshift-console.apps.example.com` (instead of the built-in domain https://console-openshift-console.apps.<random>.<location>.aroapp.io)
  - If using custom DNS, set up a [custom CA for your ingress controller](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/security/certificates/replacing-default-ingress-certificate.html) and [API server](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/security/certificates/api-server.html).

## Network Configuration

- **Virtual Network**:
  - Create or provide a VNet with two subnets for master and worker nodes.
  - Ensure Pod and Service Network CIDRs do not overlap with other network ranges. [Reference link.](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/concepts-networking#networking-for-azure-red-hat-openshift)
- **Outbound Traffic**:
  - Default deployment is with `outboundType: LoadBalancer`, meaning that a Public IP is associated with the Load Balancer for the cluster egress connectivity.
  - To restrict Internet Egress, set `--outbound-type` to `UserDefinedRouting`.
  - Consider use a Firewall solution from your choice or Azure native solutions like Azure Firewall or NAT Gateway for enhanced security. [Reference link](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/howto-create-private-cluster-4x#create-a-private-cluster-without-a-public-ip-address).

## Cluster Creation

- **Private vs Public Clusters**:
  - Private Cluster:
    - This is typically the most suitable option for production use. A Private Cluster makes the cluster API and `*.apps` endpoints private. Utilize Azure Frontdoor for Internet access to applications on a private cluster. This approach significantly enhances security by keeping the cluster and Azure resources private, managing traffic at the edge, and offering benefits such as Web Application Firewall (WAF), DDoS protection, SSL management, and offloading. For detailed implementation guidance, refer to [Azure Frontdoor documentation](/experts/aro/frontdoor/).
  - Public Cluster:
    - Opt for a Public Cluster only in situations like a "sandbox cluster" or where establishing a private method for console and API access is not feasible or desired, since the cluster API and `*.apps` endpoints will be exposed to the Internet.
- **Egress Lockdown**:
  - Note that ARO clusters do not require Internet connectivity. Learn about [Egress Lockdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/concepts-egress-lockdown).
  - All of the required connections for an ARO cluster are proxied through the service, see the [list of endpoints here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/openshift/howto-restrict-egress#endpoints-proxied-through-the-aro-service).
- **Create the Cluster**:
  - Proceed to [create your ARO cluster](/experts/aro/private-cluster/) once all prerequisites are met.

For a detailed step-by-step guide on creating your ARO cluster, refer to the official [ARO documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/).
