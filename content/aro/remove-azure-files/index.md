Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) clusters, while offering a robust application platform for containerized applications, come with a default storage class named azurefile-csi. This default storage class is provided for user convenience, allowing for immediate persistent storage provisioning using Azure Files without additional configuration. However, it's crucial to understand that this azurefile-csi storage class, by default, does not leverage a private endpoint. This can introduce a significant security vulnerability, as data traffic to and from Azure Files shares a public endpoint, potentially exposing sensitive information. Therefore, for environments with stringent security requirements, removing or replacing this default azurefile-csi storage class and implementing a solution that utilizes private endpoints is a critical step in securing your ARO deployment.

## Pre Requisites

- ARO cluster logged into
- oc cli

## Remove the default azurefile-csi storage class

To remove the default azurefile-csi storage class that comes with ARO, we first need to change the file.csi.azure.com cluster csi driver to not be managed.

After that, we can now delete the azurefile-csi storage class.

```bash
oc patch clustercsidriver  file.csi.azure.com --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"storageClassState":"Removed"}}'

oc delete sc azurefile-csi
```

## (Optional) Re-create the Azure Files Storage class with a private endpoint

Follow this [guide](/experts/aro/private_endpoint/) to create an azure files storage class with a private endpoint.
