# Solutions

## Cloud Front -> WAF -> CustomDomain -> $APP

**This is the preferred method and can also work with most third party WAF systems that act as a reverse proxy**

> Uses a custom domain, custom route, LE cert. CloudFront and WAF

* [Using Cloud Front](./cloud-front)

## Application Load Balancer -> ALB Operator -> $APP

> Installs the ALB Operator, and uses the ALB to route via WAF, one ALB per app though!

* [Application Load Balancer](./alb)
