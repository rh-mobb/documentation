The Azure Service Operator (ASO) provides Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) for Azure resources that can be used to create, update, and delete Azure services from an OpenShift cluster.

> This example uses ASO V2, which is a replacement for ASO V1. Equivalent documentation for ASO V1 can be found [here](/azure-service-operator-v1). For new installs, V2 is recommended. MOBB has not tested running them in parallel.

## Prerequisites

* [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
* [An Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) cluster](/quickstart-aro)
* The `helm` CLI tool

## Prepare your Azure Account and ARO Cluster

1. Install `cert-manager`:

   ASO relies on having the CRDs provided by [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) so it can request self-signed certificates. By default, cert-manager creates an `Issuer` of type `SelfSigned`, so it will work for ASO out-of-the-box. On an OpenShift cluster, **the easiest way to do this is by using the OCP console, navigating to 'Operators | OperatorHub' and installing it from there**; both the Red Hat certified and community versions will work. It's also possible to install by applying manifests directly as [covered here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/operators/admin/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html#olm-installing-operator-from-operatorhub-using-cli_olm-adding-operators-to-a-cluster).

1. Set the following environment variables:

    > Note: modify the cluster name, region and resource group to match your cluster

   ```bash
   AZURE_TENANT_ID=$(az account show -o tsv --query tenantId)
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show -o tsv --query id)
   CLUSTER_NAME="test-cluster"
   AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP="test-rg"
   AZURE_REGION="westus2"
   ```

1. Create a Service Principal with Contributor permissions to your subscription:

    > Note: You may want to lock this down to a specific resource group.

   ```bash
   az ad sp create-for-rbac -n "$CLUSTER_NAME-aso" \
     --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
   ```

    The result should look something like this:

   ```json
   {
      "appId": "12f48391-31ac-4565-936a-8249232aeb18",
      "displayName": "test-cluster-aso",
      "password": "xsr5Pz3IsPnnYxhsc7LhnNkY00cYxe.IPk",
      "tenant": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   }
   ```

    You'll need two of these values for the Helm deploy of ASO:

   ```bash
   AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<the_appId_from_above>
   AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<the_password_from_above>
   ```

1. Deploy the ASO Operator using Helm:

    First, add the ASO repo (this may already be present, Helm will thow a status message if so):

   ```bash
   helm repo add aso2 \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/main/v2/charts
   ```

    Then install the operator itself:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install --devel aso2 aso2/azure-service-operator \
        --create-namespace \
        --namespace=azureserviceoperator-system \
        --set azureSubscriptionID=$AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID \
        --set azureTenantID=$AZURE_TENANT_ID \
        --set azureClientID=$AZURE_CLIENT_ID \
        --set azureClientSecret=$AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```

    It will typically take 2-3 minutes for resources to converge and for the controller to be read to provision Azure resources. There will be one Pod created in the `azureserviceoperator-system` namespace with two containers, an `oc -n azureserviceoperator-system logs <pod_name> manager` will likely show a string of 'TLS handshake error' messages as the operator waits for a Certificate to be issued, but when they stop, the operator will be ready.

## Deploy an Azure Redis Cache

1. Create a Project:

   ```bash
   oc new-project redis-demo
   ```

1. Allow the redis app to run as any user:

   ```bash
   oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z redis-demo
   ```

1. Create an Azure Resource Group to hold project resources. Make sure the `namespace` matches the project name, and that the `location` is in the same region the cluster is:

   ```bash
   cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
   apiVersion: resources.azure.com/v1beta20200601
   kind: ResourceGroup
   metadata:
     name: redis-demo
     namespace: redis-demo
   spec:
     location: westus
   EOF
   ```

1. Deploy a Redis service using the ASO Operator. This also shows creating a random string as part of the hostname because the Azure DNS namespace is global, and a name like `sampleredis` is likely to be taken. Also make sure the location spec matches.


   ```yaml
   REDIS_HOSTNAME=redis-$(head -c24 < /dev/random | base64 | LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc 'a-z0-9' | cut -c -8)
   cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
   apiVersion: cache.azure.com/v1beta20201201
   kind: Redis
   metadata:
     name: $REDIS_HOSTNAME
     namespace: redis-demo
   spec:
     location: westus
     owner:
       name: redis-demo
     sku:
       family: C
       name: Basic
       capacity: 0
     enableNonSslPort: true
     redisConfiguration:
       maxmemory-delta: "10"
       maxmemory-policy: allkeys-lru
     redisVersion: "6"
     operatorSpec:
       secrets:
         primaryKey:
           name: redis-secret
           key: primaryKey
         secondaryKey:
           name: redis-secret
           key: secondaryKey
         hostName:
           name: redis-secret
           key: hostName
         port:
           name: redis-secret
           key: port
   EOF
   ```

This will take a couple of minutes to complete as well. Also note that there is typically a bit of lag between a resource being created and showing up in the Azure Portal.

1. Deploy the sample application

This uses a published sample application from Microsoft:

   ```yaml
   cat <<EOF | oc -n redis-demo apply -f -
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: azure-vote-front
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: azure-vote-front
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: azure-vote-front
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: azure-vote-front
           image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/azure-vote-front:v1
           resources:
             requests:
               cpu: 100m
               memory: 128Mi
             limits:
               cpu: 250m
               memory: 256Mi
           ports:
           - containerPort: 80
           env:
           - name: REDIS
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: redis-secret
                 key: hostName
           - name: REDIS_NAME
             value: $REDIS_HOSTNAME
           - name: REDIS_PWD
             valueFrom:
               secretKeyRef:
                 name: redis-secret
                 key: primaryKey
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
     name: azure-vote-front
   spec:
     ports:
     - port: 80
     selector:
       app: azure-vote-front
   ---
   apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
   kind: Route
   metadata:
     name: azure-vote
   spec:
     port:
       targetPort: 80
     tls:
       insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
       termination: edge
     to:
       kind: Service
       name: azure-vote-front
   EOF
   ```

1. Get the URL of the example app

   ```bash
    oc get route azure-vote
   ```

1. Browse to the URL provided by the previous command and validate that the app is working

## Cleanup

1. Delete the project containing the demo app

   ```bash
   oc delete project redis-demo
   ```
